# [MODULE] AudioShift 432Hz — System-Wide Pitch Shift | v[VERSION] | Android [MIN_API]+

---

## 📌 Description

AudioShift is a **Magisk module** that transparently shifts all system audio output from
the ISO 440 Hz standard tuning to the historical **432 Hz** reference pitch — in real time,
system-wide, without modifying any individual app.

Every sound on your device — music, video, podcasts, notifications — is pitch-shifted down
by **−31.77 cents** (≈ −32 cents) via a lightweight SoundTouch DSP pipeline injected into
the Android audio HAL.

**Why 432 Hz?**
Before ISO 16:1955 standardised concert A at 440 Hz, European orchestras commonly tuned to
432–435 Hz. Many listeners find 432 Hz more relaxing and natural. AudioShift lets you
experience all audio at that historical reference pitch, on any app, without touching the
source files.
