# AudioShift Discovery Log

**A living document of insights, breakthroughs, and unexpected findings.**

## Philosophy

This project operates under the principle that **parallel development creates discovery opportunities that single-path development cannot access**.

As we build both PATH-B and PATH-C simultaneously, we'll:
1. Document surprising findings
2. Identify cross-track synergies
3. Extract novel insights about Android audio architecture
4. Potentially discover new technologies or optimizations

## Week 1 (Setup Phase)

### Entry 1: Project Initialization
**Date:** 2025-02-23
**Type:** Project Start
**Impact:** High

**Discovery:** Complete repository structure scaffolded with dual-path architecture framework

**Path Impact:** Both PATH-B and PATH-C

**Significance:** Foundation established for parallel development. Discovery framework in place to capture insights as they emerge.

**Next Steps:**
1. Begin Phase 2: AudioFlinger investigation (PATH-B) and Magisk hooking research (PATH-C)
2. Schedule first weekly sync
3. Start collecting initial architecture insights
